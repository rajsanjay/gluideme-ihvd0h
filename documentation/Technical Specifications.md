# Technical Specifications

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Transfer Requirements Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline and automate the complex process of managing course transfer requirements between California community colleges and 4-year institutions. The system addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accurate, accessible transfer pathways by providing automated requirement parsing, real-time validation, and intuitive interfaces for both administrators and students.

This solution targets the inefficiencies and error-prone nature of manual transfer requirement management, promising to reduce administrative overhead by 70% while significantly improving the accuracy and transparency of transfer pathways for approximately 2.1 million California community college students.

# 7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## 7.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

### 7.1.1 Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant AuthService
    participant API
    participant Database

    User->>Frontend: Login Request
    Frontend->>AuthService: Authenticate

    Database-->>AuthService: User Data
    AuthService-->>Frontend: JWT + Refresh Token
    Frontend->>API: Request + JWT
    API->>AuthService: Validate Token
    AuthService-->>API: Token Valid
    API-->>Frontend: Protected Resource
```

    D --> G[TLS 1.3]
    E --> H[RDS Encryption]
    
    F --> I[Encrypted Storage]
    G --> I
