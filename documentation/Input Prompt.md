## WHY - Vision & Purpose

Purpose & Users

- The application solves the complex problem of managing and validating course transfer requirements between community colleges and 4-year institutions, specifically for academic advisors and students in California.

- Primary users are:

  1. Academic administrators who need to input and manage transfer requirements

  2. Students planning their transfer pathway

  3. Academic counselors advising students on transfer requirements

- The application provides advantages over alternatives by:

  1. Automating the extraction of transfer rules from structured data

  2. Providing real-time validation of course selections

  3. Offering a user-friendly interface for both administrators and students

  4. Maintaining historical records of transfer requirements by academic year

## WHAT - Core Requirements

Functional Requirements

System must provide for Administrators:

- Allow upload of transfer requirement data in CSV and JSON formats

- Automatically extract and parse transfer rules into standardized JSON structure

- Enable manual review and adjustment of extracted rules

- Support batch processing of multiple transfer requirement documents

- Maintain versioning of transfer requirements by academic year and major

- Store validated transfer requirements in the database

System must provide for Students:

- Allow selection of source institution (community college)

- Allow selection of target institution and major

- Display required and recommended courses for transfer

- Validate selected courses against transfer requirements in real-time

- Show progress towards transfer requirements completion

- Alert students about missing or invalid course combinations

System must provide for Data Management:

- Maintain data consistency across different academic years

- Support updates to transfer requirements while preserving historical data

- Enable search across transfer requirements by institution and major

- Provide audit trails of requirement changes

- Handle complex course equivalencies and prerequisites

## HOW - Planning & Implementation

Technical Implementation

Frontend Architecture:

- Next.js application with server-side rendering

- ShadcnUI component library for consistent UI

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

- State management using React Context or Redux

- Form handling with React Hook Form

- Client-side validation using Zod

Backend Architecture:

- Django REST Framework for API development

- PostgreSQL for relational data storage

- MeiliSearch for fast course and requirement searches

- Pinecone for AI-powered similarity searches

- JWT authentication

- RESTful API endpoints

Infrastructure:

- AWS Amplify for frontend hosting

- AWS EC2 for backend services

- Jenkins for backend CI/CD

- AWS RDS for PostgreSQL

- CloudWatch for monitoring

- S3 for document storage

System Requirements:

- Performance:

  - Page load times under 2 seconds

  - Search results returned in under 500ms

  - Support for 1000+ concurrent users

- Security:

  - Role-based access control

  - Encrypted data transmission

  - Regular security audits

- Scalability:

  - Horizontal scaling for API servers

  - Database sharding capability

  - Caching layer for frequent queries

## User Experience

Key User Flows:

Administrator Flow:

1. Login to admin portal

2. Upload transfer requirement documents

3. Review extracted rules

4. Approve or modify mappings

5. Publish requirements

Student Flow:

1. Select transfer pathway (source/target institutions)

2. View transfer requirements

3. Select completed/planned courses

4. Receive validation feedback

5. Save/export transfer plan

## Business Requirements

Access & Authentication:

- Admin users require email verification

- Student accounts linked to college email

- Password requirements following NIST guidelines

- Session management with automatic timeout

Business Rules:

- All course requirements must be validated against source data

- Transfer requirements must be version-controlled by academic year

- Course equivalencies must be bidirectional

- Changes to requirements must be logged with timestamp and user

- Students must be notified of requirement changes affecting their plans

## Implementation Priorities

High Priority:

- Transfer requirement data ingestion and parsing

- Course selection and validation engine
